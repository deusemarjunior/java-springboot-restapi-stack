Stack Java Spring Boot REST API is a set of tools, methodologies, practices and concepts that together support the development of REST APIs in Java. Coding, Validating and Integrating business hypotheses into the product becomes simpler and more productive as good usage and configuration practices are already present from the beginning of development.

## Stack Structure

The Stack Java Spring Boot REST API is aimed at building Web Services using Java and Spring as main technologies. The template allows the construction of projects with the technologies below.

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Spring Actuator
- Spring OpenAPI
- Zalando Problem Details Web
- Spring Validation with Bean Validation
- Spring Test with JUnit5 and JsonPath

Stack offers, through the base template, an initial project structured with the above technologies, along with a set of examples following good practices on how to Code, Document and Test your APIs.

When creating a project using the **_Stack Java Spring Boot REST API_**, your project starts with essential web publishing capabilities such as APIs for HealthCheck verification, including `liveness` and `readiness` for Kubernets; Documentation following the **OpenAPI** specification; Exception Handler based on **RFC 7807 Problem Details**; Examples of Controllers and tests for them.

It is also possible to expand the capabilities of the template by using Plugins that enable the use of tools such as Relational Databases, Queues, Security Mechanisms and others.
